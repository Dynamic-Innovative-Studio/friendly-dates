# 🤝 Contributing to `Dynamic Innovative Studio`

Welcome! 👋  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this organization-wide repository. This repo is not for code-heavy development but for maintaining **structure, templates, documentation**, and **organizational clarity**.

---

## 🧠 What Can You Contribute?

Here are a few ways you can help improve the repository:

- 📝 Improve or update documentation (`docs/`)
- 🏗️ Suggest better repo or folder structures
- 🧾 Add or refine templates (issue, PR, folder, etc.)
- 🧑‍💼 Update the org chart or role descriptions
- 📚 Add missing info (tools used, onboarding docs, etc.)
- 🧹 Fix typos, formatting, or outdated info

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**  
2. **Create a new branch** (e.g., `improve-docs-structure`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Commit with a clear message**
5. **Open a pull request** with a short description

---

## 📋 Guidelines

- Keep language **clear, concise, and inclusive**
- Prefer **Markdown (`.md`)** for documentation
- Link to existing content rather than duplicating it
- Stick to the **existing folder structure** unless you propose an improvement
- **One purpose per pull request** (e.g., don't update docs *and* restructure folders in the same PR)
